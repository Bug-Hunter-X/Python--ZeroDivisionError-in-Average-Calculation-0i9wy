This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python: handling empty sequences. The original code attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers but fails when the list is empty, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`.  The corrected code includes a check for an empty list and returns 0 to gracefully handle this situation.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in your code.
